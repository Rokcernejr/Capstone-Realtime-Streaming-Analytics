# Capstone-Realtime-Streaming-Analytics
Using AWS Kinesis and EMR to accomplish real time Twitter and Stock Analysis.

#### Team Members: Brandyn Adderley


Numerous companies are interested in using microblogging as a way to predict in real time how stock prices are going to move. At no other time in human history did investors have access to the real time thoughts and voices of the masses. The theory is if investors had a good sense of how customers felt about a particular company at any given time would give insight to how the “market” values the company and thus the price and volume of the stocks.

Even beyond the idea of analyzing tweets in real time, the idea of accessing real time information and using that to make decisions is the future. There is a diminishing value of data as time progresses. Insights are indeed perishable. But if you have the ability to combine old and recent data, that's even more valuable.


The goal of this project is twofold:
1. Set Up a production ready real time streaming analytics system using AWS.
2. Use sentiment analysis of tweet to predict stock prices.
